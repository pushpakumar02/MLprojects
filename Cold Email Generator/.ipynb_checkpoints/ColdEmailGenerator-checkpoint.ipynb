      "Dear Hiring Team,\n",
      "\n",
      "I am excited to apply for the Developer Platforms Intern position at Zoox, as advertised on your website. With a strong passion for software development and machine learning, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this role.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Central Missouri, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. My experience with web development frameworks such as ReactJS, ExpressJS, and NodeJS, as well as databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite, will enable me to contribute to the development of the Observability Platform at Zoox.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my previous internships, I have demonstrated my ability to design and develop scalable solutions. For instance, I developed Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks, increasing team productivity by 30%, and collaborated on securing automation scripts by integrating input validation and exception handling. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in building and maintaining infrastructure to ship, store, and process terabytes of telemetry data at Zoox.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work with distributed systems, telemetry, and observability tools. My experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS will be valuable in provisioning and operating infrastructure, and my proficiency in languages like Python, TypeScript, and C++ will enable me to design and develop SDKs to emit telemetry signals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to my technical skills, I have excellent communication and collaboration skills, which I believe are essential for success in this role. As a member of the UCM Graduate Student Association, I have organized workshops on professional development and technical skills for graduate students and collaborated with university stakeholders to improve graduate student experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am impressed by Zoox's mission to develop a fully autonomous vehicle fleet and the supporting ecosystem required to bring this technology to market. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to this mission and be part of a fast-moving and highly execution-oriented team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.\n",
